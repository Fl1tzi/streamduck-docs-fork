# Backup
This page explains what you have to do to completely backup Streamduck data

## Device configs
Device configs contain all the information that is related to the device including button layout, images, plugin data

Configs can be either exported with your client of choice, or saved by making a copy of [device config folder](configuration.md#device-config-path)

## Plugins
If you're using plugins, you should back up [plugins folder](configuration.md#plugins-path)

## Plugin settings
[Plugin settings file](configuration.md#plugin-settings-path) contains all settings of plugins/modules including settings of core module, it should be backed up for plugins to remember their global settings
